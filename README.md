# Password Strength Checker (Python)

A security-focused Python script that evaluates the strength of a password based on specific character requirements. This tool demonstrates the practical application of *Regular Expressions (Regex)* for data validation.

## Features
* *Length Validation:* Checks if the password meets the minimum requirement of 8 characters.
* *Character Diversity:* Identifies the presence of:
    * Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    * Lowercase letters (a-z)
    * Numerical digits (0-9)
    * Special characters (e.g., @, $, !, %, *, ?, &)
* *Real-time Feedback:* Provides a clear "Strong" or "Weak" status based on security criteria.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* *Regex Integration:* Efficient use of the re module to scan strings for patterns.
* *Boolean Logic:* Implementing complex conditional checks to determine the final strength score.
* *Modular Code:* Clean function-based structure for better readability and reuse.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python PasswordStrength.py
